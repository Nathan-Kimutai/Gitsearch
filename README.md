## Getting started
You can use the editor of your choice but for this case I used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

If you don't have npm installed yet you can install by doing the following
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install npm
```

Check the npm version 
```bash
nmp -v
```

Then you have to install angular CLI by doing the following

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Check the version
```bash
ng --version
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).












## Usage

You can navigate to [http://localhost:4567/](http://localhost:4567/) as it works with most spark appications
